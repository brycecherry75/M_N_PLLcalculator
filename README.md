# M_N_PLLcalculator
Calculate frequencies with a PLL (such as those in video cards) with Reference and VCO dividers as described in M_N_PLL.gif

Consult your PLL datasheet for applicable parameters required by the Python script: python M_N_PLLcalculator.py -h

NOTE: The M and N dividers in certain PLLs are swapped and/or have an offset.
